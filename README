To use this code:

1. Download the poleposition benchmark from http://polepos.org - direct link http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=134549
2. Overlay the files from this repository.
3. Start OrientDb server and create a new database 'polepos'.
4. Run 'RunSeason'

Configuration options are held in: settings/orientdb.properties

Known issues:
- Not sure db connections are being used in the most efficient way (first experience with OrientDb, more of a case of 'hacking it until it worked')
- Could not get raw binding (https://github.com/orientechnologies/orientdb/wiki/Object-2-Record-Java-Binding#raw-binding) to work, annotations weren't being recognised so persisted entity fields were renamed to meet naming convention requirements
- Have added 'massiveIntent' declarations before doing big writes but have not done the same for massiveRead, not sure if it is needed.
